### Can you reverse engineer our source code from our ipa/apk file?
We cannot reverse engineer source code from an app and we do not need any source code access.

### If I change my app, let’s say I move the search button and call it find instead of search, do I have to update camelQA?
Our model is self-healing, meaning you won’t need to update your script for minor changes. If you use our reasoning model, you won't need to update your scripts for most changes.

### Do I have to write my own test cases?
Yes, but automatic test case creation is our most requested feature… and it’s coming soon!

### How detailed should I be with my test cases?
camelQA sees as a person sees. If a new user wouldn’t know how to complete a task without steps, assume camelQA will not either.

### Do you train camelQA on my app?
We do not train our models on your app.

### Do you retain any data from my app?
CamelQA does not retain any data from your app and does not allow OpenAI to retain any of your data.

### What devices can I use to run camelQA?
Your own local devices or any device farm service. camelQA does not offer devices.

### Do you need access to our database or any PII?
We do not need access to your database and we do not retain or interface with any of your PII.

### Do you use any 3rd party software or development?
All of camelQA’s models are built in-house, we do not have any contractors or offshore teams.

### How old is camelQA?
We’re a high velocity startup up which began development in 2023 and launched in February of 2024.
