Certain commands can be issued in the prompt.

## Long Press
**Long press the \<button name\> button** 

This is the command to tap and hold on a region. By default, this holds down for 3 seconds.

Example:
```swift
q.execute("Long press the record button")
```

## Exact text match
If you would like camelQA to provide an exact string match, specify the text in single quotes.

Here is an example:
```swift
q.assertCondition("the screenshot shows the header 'Welcome!'")
```
