# Getting started with Xcode 
iOS only - Fastest for those without Appium setup on their machine

### Setup Xcode

1. Open an existing project in Xcode
2. In the top menu bar go to File -> Add package dependencies
3. In the search field in the top right corner paste https://github.com/qaml-ai/qaml-swift
4. Click add package
5. Select your UITest target, NOT your main app target
6. Start writing tests!

### Writing Tests in qaml-swift

1. Go to a test File
2. Include `import qaml` at the top
3. Create a new test function:

```swift
    @MainActor
    func testAppleNews() async throws {
        // Set the bundle ID of the app you'd like to test
        let app = XCUIApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.news")
        app.launch()
        
        let q = QamlClient(apiKey: "<api key>", app: app)
        
        try await q.execute("click the sports tab")
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1 * NSEC_PER_SEC)
        try await q.execute("scroll down")
        try await q.execute("tap the first image")
        try await q.assertCondition("The screen shows a Get Started button")
    }
```
4. Select the device you'd like to run your test on at the top. 
  > - For physical devices, attach your device to your computer via USB. 
  > - For simulated devices, select your desired device from the drop down menu.
  > - For third party device farms, following their XCUITest documentation.
  > - [AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/devicefarm/latest/developerguide/test-types-ios-xctest-ui.html), [Sauce Labs Docs](https://docs.saucelabs.com/mobile-apps/automated-testing/espresso-xcuitest/), [Browserstack Docs](https://www.browserstack.com/docs/app-automate/api-reference/xcuitest/overview). 

<Note>If you have XCode cloud set up, these tests will run as part of your Xcode cloud actions. Apple offers iOS developers 25 hours of free device farm access per month.

Read more about this on [Xcode's documentation](https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/#:~:text=Apple%20Developer%20Program%20membership%20includes,Cloud%20monthly%20subscriptions%20are%20available.&text=Upgrade%20or%20downgrade%20your%20subscription%20at%20any%20time.

# Getting started with Python 
iOS and Adroid - Requires Appium and WebDriverAgent setup

### Setup Your Machine
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="mobile" title="Plug in a phone">
    Plug in an Android or iPhone to your machine. If no devices are connected it will fallback to the iOS Simulator.
  <Info>
  **IMPORTANT** Ensure your device has [developer mode](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/enabling-developer-mode-on-a-device) turned on. 
  </Info>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Run Appium in your terminal">
    Ensure your are running [appium](https://appium.io/docs/en/2.5/quickstart/install/) on your machine.
	  Use Homebrew on macOS `brew install appium` or follow the instructions linked above.
	  
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Ensure you have mjpeg-consumer on your machine">
    Using mjpeg-consumer is optional; however, it is strongly recommended because it significantly speeds up execution.
    Here's how to install `mjpeg-consumer` on your machine. Navigate to your appium directory.
    ```
    cd `which appium`/..
    ```
    Install `mjpeg-consumer`.
    ```
    npm i mjpeg-consumer
    ```
    Optionally, navigate back to your previous directory
    ```
    cd -
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Spin up your virtual environment">
    Create your VE 
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
    Activate your VE
    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>


### Install qaml and start controling your device in natural language

```
pip install qaml
```

Or update the CLI with `pip install -U qaml`

Set the QAML_API_KEY environment variable to your API key
```
export QAML_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```
Start using qaml in python or command line
