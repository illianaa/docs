# Setup in Xcode (fastest for those without Appium)

### Setup Xcode

1. Open an existing project in Xcode
2. In the top menu bar go to File -> Add package dependencies
3. In the search field in the top right corner paste https://github.com/qaml-ai/qaml-swift
4. Click add package
5. Select your UITest target, NOT your main app target
6. Start writing tests!

### Writing Tests in qaml-swift

1. Go to a test File
2. Include `Import qaml` at the top
3. Create a new test function:

```
    @MainActor
    func testSearching() async throws {
        // UI tests must launch the application that they test.
        let app = XCUIApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.apple.mobilesafari")
        app.launch()
        
        let q = QamlClient(apiKey: "sk-209e6c3a003b698ef98abd009f1a1a6bda39aa544bcb8bde279f39114a6f2b4a", app: app)
        
        try await q.execute("type google.com into the search bar at the bottom")
        try await q.execute("tap go")
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1 * NSEC_PER_SEC)
        try await q.execute("scroll down")
        try await q.assertCondition("The screen shows google's site")
    }
```

# Setup in Python (repl support)

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Ensure you have mjpeg-consumer on your machine">
    Using mjpeg-consumer is optional; however, it is strongly recommended because it significantly speeds up execution.
    Here's how to install `mjpeg-consumer` on your machine. Navigate to your appium directory.
    ```
    cd `which appium`/..
    ```
    Install `mjpeg-consumer`.
    ```
    npm i mjpeg-consumer

    Optionally, navigate back to your previous directory
    ```
    cd -
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Spin up your virtual environment">
    Create your VE 
    ```
    python3 -m venv .venv
    ```
    Activate your VE
    ```
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### Install qaml and start controling your device in natural language

<Info>
  **IMPORTANT** Generate an API key on our [frontend](https://dash.camelqa.com/login)
</Info>

```
pip install qaml
```

Or update the CLI with `pip install -U qaml`

Set the QAML_API_KEY environment variable to your API key
```
export QAML_API_KEY=<API_KEY>
```
Start using qaml in python or command line
