# Client
To Initialize a python client for camelQA, you must pass in an API key and optionally these parameters:

```python
q = qaml.Client(
    api_key="<API_KEY>, 
    driver=optional_appium_driver, #optional
    use_mjpeg=optional_boolean, #optional, default=True
    use_hid_typing=optional_boolean #optional, default=False
)
```
#### driver
This is the Appium driver instance you can use to specify your UDID for your device or simulator. This can also be used to connect to a device farm.

Tip: 
```bash
xcrun simctl list devices | grep 'Booted'
```
This command gives you a list of UDIDs of all simulators currently running.

#### use_mjpeg
This flag tells qaml to use `mjpeg_consumer` if it is installed. This will speed up the time it takes to capture a screenshot, but is slightly resource intensive. If you have issues, try turning setting this to False.

#### use_hid_typing
This is an experimental feature to extend typing compatibility. This is for apps where typing is not supported by Appium. This flag simulates a USB keyboard. This is slow and only works with latin characters and numbers.

Please let us know in our Discord how this feature works for your app. 

# execute
This is the main way you interact with qaml. Give a natural language command and it will execute the command. 

```python
q.execute("tap the address bar")
q.execute("type camelqa.com")
q.execute("tap go")
q.execute("scroll down")
q.execute("open the apple music app")
...
```

Nothing is returned. A `QAMLExecException` will be thrown if it is unable to execute the command.

## assert_condition
This is how you tell qaml to verify something without taking any action. 

```python
q.execute("type camelqa.com")
q.assert_condition("camelqa.com is shown")
q.execute("tap go")
q.assert_condition("loading screen is shown")
...
```

Nothing is returned. A `QAMLExecException` will be thrown if the condition is not met.

# system_prompt
This appends information to the qaml system prompt. Use this to specify details about your app. 

```python
q.system_prompt = "Never scroll down, even if the user asks for it."
...
```
