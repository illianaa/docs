# Client
To Initialize a python client for camelQA, you must pass in an API key and optional parameters. Note that parameters differ based on implementation.

<Tabs>
    <Tab title="iOS">
        ```swift
        // Set the bundle ID of the app you'd like to test
        let app = XCUIApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.toyopagroup.picaboo")
        app.launch()

        let q = QamlClient(
            apiKey: "<API_KEY>", 
            app: "<APP_INSTANCE>", 
            useAccessibilityElements: <BOOL, default = true>
        )
        ```

        #### app
        This is the [bundleID](https://offcornerdev.com/bundleid.html) of the app you'd like to launch. **Note** you can still switch between apps by using switchToApp or openURL.

        #### useAccessibilityElements
        Tests executed in XCUITest can utilize accessibility labels. Setting this to true leverages accessibility and setting this to false disables the feature.

    <Tab title="Android">
        <CodeGroup>
        ```java Groovy/Java
            @Test
            public void newTest() {
                Client q = new Client("<APIKey>");
            }
        ```
        ```kotlin Kotlin DSL
            @Test
            fun newTest() {
                val q = QamlClient(apiKey = "<APIKey>")
            }
        ```
        </CodeGroup>

        There are no additional fields for the Andoid client at this time.
    </Tab>


    <Tab title="Appium">
        ```python
        q = qaml.Client(
            api_key="<API_KEY>", 
            driver=optional_appium_driver, #optional
            use_mjpeg=optional_boolean, #optional, default=True
            use_hid_typing=optional_boolean #optional, default=False
        )
        ```

        #### driver
        This is the Appium driver instance you can use to specify your UDID for your device or simulator. This can also be used to connect to a device farm.

        Tip: 
        ```bash
        xcrun simctl list devices | grep 'Booted'
        ```
        This command gives you a list of UDIDs of all simulators currently running.

        #### use_mjpeg
        This flag tells qaml to use `mjpeg_consumer` if it is installed. This will speed up the time it takes to capture a screenshot, but is slightly resource intensive. If you have issues, try turning setting this to False.

        #### use_hid_typing
        This is an experimental feature to extend typing compatibility. This is for apps where typing is not supported by Appium. This flag simulates a USB keyboard. This is slow and only works with latin characters and numbers.

        Please let us know in our Discord how this feature works for your app.

# Actions

## execute

This is the main way you interact with qaml. Give a natural language command and it will execute the command. 

<CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    try await q.execute("swipe down")
    try await q.execute("tap the search bar")
    ```



    ```kotlin Kotlin DSL
    q.execute("swipe up")
    q.execute("tap the search bar")
    
    ```
    ```java Groovy/Java
    q.execute("swipe up");
    q.execute("tap the search bar");
    
    ```


    ```python Appium
    q.execute("swipe up")
    q.execute("swipe down")
    ```
</CodeGroup>
    
Nothing is returned. A `QAMLExecException` will be thrown if it is unable to execute the command.

## assert_condition
This is how you tell qaml to verify something without taking any action. 

<CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    try await q.execute("type camelqa.com")
    try await q.assert_condition("camelqa.com is shown")
    try await q.execute("tap go")
    try await q.assert_condition("loading screen is shown")
    ```



    ```kotlin Kotlin DSL
    q.execute("type camelqa.com")
    q.assert_condition("camelqa.com is shown")
    q.execute("tap go")
    q.assert_condition("loading screen is shown")
    
    ```
    ```java Groovy/Java
    q.execute("type camelqa.com");
    q.assert_condition("camelqa.com is shown");
    q.execute("tap go");
    q.assert_condition("loading screen is shown");
    
    ```


    ```python Appium
    q.execute("type camelqa.com")
    q.assert_condition("camelqa.com is shown")
    q.execute("tap go")
    q.assert_condition("loading screen is shown")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

Nothing is returned. A `QAMLExecException` will be thrown if the condition is not met.

## wait_until
An iteration of assert, this is how you tell qaml to wait until an event occurs (ex. screen has completed loading)


<CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    try await q.waitUntil(
        condition: <String>, 
        timeout: <TimeInterval> // optional, default is 10 seconds
    )

    // example:
    try await q.waitUntil("Results page has completed loading")
    ```

    ```kotlin Kotlin DSL
    q.waitUntil(
        condition: <String>, 
        timeout: <TimeInterval> // optional, default is 10 seconds
    )

    // example:
    q.waitUntil("Results page has completed loading")
    
    ```
    ```java Groovy/Java
    q.waitUntil(
        condition: <String>, 
        timeout: <TimeInterval> // optional, default is 10 seconds
    );

    // example:
    q.waitUntil("Results page has completed loading");
    
    ```
    
    ```python Appium
    # not supported in python at this time
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## system_prompt
This appends information to the qaml system prompt. Use this to specify details about your app. 

<CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    q.systemPrompt = "Never scroll down, even if the user asks for it."
    ```

    ```kotlin Kotlin DSL
    // in progress

    ```
    ```java Groovy/Java
    // in progress

    ```

    ```python Appium
    q.system_prompt = "Never scroll down, even if the user asks for it."
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## switch_to_app
This is how to switch between apps. For iOS, use the [bundleID](https://offcornerdev.com/bundleid.html). For Android, use the [package ID](https://support.google.com/admob/answer/9972781?hl=en#:~:text=You%20can%20find%20an%20app's,id%3Dcom.).

<Warning>Note: for iOS, you must swtich to an app using this function in order to interact with that app.</Warning>

<CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    try await q.switchToApp(bundleId: "com.apple.mobilesafari")
    ```

    ```kotlin Kotlin DSL
    q.switchToApp(packageName = "com.google.android.youtube")
    
    ```
    ```java Groovy/Java
    q.switchToApp(packageName = "com.google.android.youtube");
    
    ```

    ```python Appium
    # use bundleID or package
    q.switch_to_app("com.apple.mobilesafari")
    ```
</CodeGroup>

## open_URL 
This is how to open a specific URL. 

<CodeGroup>
    ```swift iOS
    try await q.openURL(url: "https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence")
    ```

    ```kotlin Kotlin DSL
    q.openURL("https://google.com")
    
    ```
    ```java Groovy/Java
    q.openURL("https://google.com");
    
    ```

    ```python Appium
    # not supported in python at this time
    ```
</CodeGroup>
