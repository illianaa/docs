## Python library
You can use qaml from Python to automate tasks in natural language. Initialize the qaml client with your API key and then start executing commands:

```python
import qaml

q = qaml.Client(api_key="<API_KEY>")

q.execute("tap the address bar")
q.execute("type camelqa.com")
q.execute("tap go")
q.execute("scroll down")
q.execute("open the apple music app")
...
```

## Appium integration
qaml integrates with Appium so you can use your existing Appium client and server configurations. To use a custom Appium configuration pass an Appium driver instance to the qaml Client constructor:

```python
import qaml

q = qaml.Client(driver=appium_driver, api_key="<API_KEY>")

q.execute("<NATURAL_LANGUAGE_COMMAND>")
...
```

Using your own Appium driver allows you to easily integrate with device clouds like [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com) and [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com)
