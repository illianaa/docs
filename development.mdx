    ## Swift package
    You can use qaml from XCUITest to automate tasks in natural language. Initialize the qaml client with your API key and then start executing commands:

    ```swift
    import qaml

    // Set the bundle ID of the app you'd like to test
    let app = XCUIApplication(bundleIdentifier: "com.toyopagroup.picaboo")
    app.launch()

    let q = QamlClient(apiKey: "<API_KEY>", app: "<APP_INSTANCE>")

    try await q.execute("tap the address bar")
    try await q.execute("type camelqa.com")
    ```

    ## Updating the package
    Please be sure to update your package. To update, open XCode > File > Packages > Update to Latest Package Version.

    ## XCode Cloud integration
    If you have XCode cloud set up, these tests will run as part of your Xcode cloud actions. Apple offers iOS developers 25 hours of free device farm access per month. Read more about this on [Xcodeâ€™s documentation](https://developer.apple.com/xcode-cloud/#:~:text=Apple%20Developer%20Program%20membership%20includes,Cloud%20monthly%20subscriptions%20are%20available.&text=Upgrade%20or%20downgrade%20your%20subscription%20at%20any%20time.).

    ## Python library
    You can use qaml from Python to automate tasks in natural language. Initialize the qaml client with your API key and then start executing commands:

    ```python
    import qaml

    q = qaml.Client(api_key="<API_KEY>")

    q.execute("tap the address bar")
    q.execute("type camelqa.com")
    q.execute("tap go")
    q.execute("scroll down")
    q.execute("open the apple music app")
    ...
    ```

    ## Updating the library
    Run `pip install -U qaml` to update to the latest verison of qaml

    ## Appium integration
    qaml integrates with Appium so you can use your existing Appium client and server configurations. To use a custom Appium configuration pass an Appium driver instance to the qaml Client constructor:

    ```python
    import qaml

    q = qaml.Client(driver=appium_driver, api_key="<API_KEY>")

    q.execute("<NATURAL_LANGUAGE_COMMAND>")
    ...
    ```

    Using your own Appium driver allows you to easily integrate with device clouds like [SauceLabs](https://saucelabs.com) and [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com)
