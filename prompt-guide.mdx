qaml uses AI to turn your natural language into app automations. Aside from the basic qaml commands, `q.execute()`, `q.assert_condition()`, and `q.system_prompt ()`, there are other quirks that we've noticed. 

Please use this guide as best practices when issuing commands to qaml.

## App Switching
**Switch to \<app name\> app** 

This is the command for opening an app or switching between apps. This performs more consistently than "Open the \<app name\> app". 

Example:
```python
q.execute("Switch to Apple Music app")
q.asssert("We are in the Apple Music app") # optional, used to confirm the app switch was successful
```
